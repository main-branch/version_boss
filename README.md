Parse, compare, and increment Gem and [SemVer](https://semver.org) versions.

This gem installs the `gem-version-boss` command-line tool to display and increment a
gem's version based on [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) rules.

`gem-version-boss` can replace the `bump` command from the [bump
gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/bump/) for incrementing gem version strings.

How `gem-version-boss` differs from `bump`:

* `gem-version-boss` can manage pre-release versions
* `gem-version-boss` can not commit or tag the version file changes it makes
* `gem-version-boss` can not update multiple files at a time

Example CLI commands:

```shell
# Increment the gem version
gem-version-boss {next-major|next-minor|next-patch} [--pre [--pretype=TYPE]] [--dryrun]
gem-version-boss next-pre [--pretype=TYPE] [--dryrun]
gem-version-boss next-release [--dryrun]

# Command to display the current gem version
gem-version-boss current

# Display the gem version file
gem-version-boss file

# Validate that a version is valid
gem-version-boss validate VERSION

# Get more detailed help for each command listed above
gem-version-boss help [COMMAND]
```

## Installation

To install the gem, add to the following line to your application's gemspec OR
Gemfile:

gemspec:

```ruby
  spec.add_development_dependency "version_boss", '~> 0.1'
```

Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "version_boss", "~> 0.1", groups: [:development, :test]
```

and then run `bundle install`.

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

```shell
gem install version_boss
```

## Command Line

### Usage

The `gem-version-boss` command line has built in help for all its commands. List the
commands by invoking `gem-version-boss` with no arguments or `gem-version-boss help` as
follows:

```shell
gem-version-boss help
```

The output is the following:

```shell
Commands:
  gem-version-boss current [-q]                                   # Show the current gem version
  gem-version-boss file [-q]                                      # Show the path to the file containing the gem version
  gem-version-boss help [COMMAND]                                 # Describe available commands or one specific command
  gem-version-boss next-major [VERSION] [-p [-t TYPE]] [-n] [-q]  # Increment the version's major part
  gem-version-boss next-minor [VERSION] [-p [-t TYPE]] [-n] [-q]  # Increment the version's minor part
  gem-version-boss next-patch [VERSION] [-p [-t TYPE]] [-n] [-q]  # Increment the version's patch part
  gem-version-boss next-pre [VERSION] [-t TYPE] [-n] [-q]         # Increment the version's pre-release part
  gem-version-boss next-release [VERSION] [-n] [-q]               # Increment a pre-release version to the release version
  gem-version-boss validate VERSION [-q]                          # Validate the given version
```

The `gem-version-boss help COMMAND` command will give further help for a specific command:

```shell
gem-version-boss help current
```

The output is the following:

```shell
Usage:
  gem-version-boss current [-q]

Options:
  -q, [--quiet], [--no-quiet], [--skip-quiet]  # Do not print the current version to stdout

Description:
  Output the current gem version from the file that stores the gem version.

  The command fails if the gem version could not be found or is invalid.

  Use `--quiet` to ensure that a gem version could be found and is valid without producing any output.
```

### Examples

Assuming the gem version starts at 1.2.3:

```shell
$ gem-version-boss current
1.2.3

$ gem-version-boss next-patch
1.2.4

$ gem-version-boss next-minor
1.3.0

$ gem-version-boss next-major
2.0.0

# Create a pre-release version for the next major version
$ gem-version-boss next-major --pre --pre-type=alpha
3.0.0.alpha1

# Increment the pre-release version
$ gem-version-boss next-pre
3.0.0.alpha2

# Change the pre-release type to "beta"
$ gem-version-boss next-pre --pre-type=beta
3.0.0.beta1

# Create a release version from the pre-release version
$ gem-version-boss next-release
3.0.0
```

## Library Usage

[Detailed API documenation](https://rubydoc.info/gems/version_boss/) is hosted on
rubygems.org.

The main classes are:

### VersionBoss::Gem classes

* **VersionBoss::Gem::Version** knows how to parse, validate, and compare [Ruby Gem
  version strings](https://guides.rubygems.org/patterns/#semantic-versioning) which
  may include [prerelease
  versions](https://guides.rubygems.org/patterns/#prerelease-gems).

* **VersionBoss::Gem::IncrementableVersion** knows how to increment Ruby Gem version
  strings according to SemVer rules.

* **VersionBoss::Gem::VersionFileFactory**: find the gem's version file and returns a
  **VersionBoss::Gem::VersionFile** that knows it's path, the contained version, and
  how to update the version file with a new version.

### VersionBoss::Semver classes

* **VersionBoss::Semver::Version** knows how to parse, validate, and compare version
  strings that conform to [SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)

* **VersionBoss::Semver::IncrementableVersion** knows how to increment Semver version
  strings according to SemVer rules.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake
spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that
will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git
commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at
https://github.com/main-branch/version_boss.

### Commit message guidelines

All commit messages must follow the [Conventional Commits
standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). This helps us maintain a
clear and structured commit history, automate versioning, and generate changelogs
effectively.

To ensure compliance, this project includes:

* A git commit-msg hook that validates your commit messages before they are accepted.

  To activate the hook, you must have node installed and run `npm install`.

* A GitHub Actions workflow that will enforce the Conventional Commit standard as
  part of the continuous integration pipeline.

  Any commit message that does not conform to the Conventional Commits standard will
  cause the workflow to fail and not allow the PR to be merged.

### Pull request guidelines

All pull requests must be merged using rebase merges. This ensures that commit
messages from the feature branch are preserved in the release branch, keeping the
history clean and meaningful.
